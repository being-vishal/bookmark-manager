# bookmark-manager
I have made this project to improve my JavaScript Skills. By doing this project I have improved in DOM manipulation. 
I want to improve this project by adding features such as search for a bookmark, segregate bookmarks according to user needs and want to store those bookmarks in a databse rather than using local storage.
