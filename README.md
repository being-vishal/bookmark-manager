# bookmark-manager
I have made this project to improve my JavaScript Skills. By doing this project I have improved in DOM manipulation. To store bookmarks firebase firestore is used as the databse and 
Sign-in with Google has been implemented for easy access, due to this the bookmarks are synced and hence one can access them from any browsser regardless of the device being used.
